#Learning Jave

This is just a repo to store notes as I get reacquainted with
a computer science background. Some of it will likely be java
related, but it will also be math/logic heavy. (Okay, probably
"algorithms" would work, but I suspect that I will be using 
math texts rather than programming manuals for the most part.)

* [Algorithms](./algorithms) a brief collection of algorithms
and algorithm related notes.
