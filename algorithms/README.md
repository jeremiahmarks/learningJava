According to ```http://www.sorting-algorithms.com/``` ,


The ideal sorting algorithm would have the following properties:

* Stable: Equal keys aren't reordered.
* Operates in place, requiring O(1) extra space.
* Worst-case O(nÂ·lg(n)) key comparisons.
* Worst-case O(n) swaps.
* Adaptive: Speeds up to O(n) when data is nearly sorted or when there are few unique keys.
